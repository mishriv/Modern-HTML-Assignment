            <h2>Feature 1: Improved multimedia Support</h2>
            <p>HTML5 includes native support for audio and video playback using the &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt;
                elements. This eliminates the need for third-party plugins like Flash and enhances the multimedia
                experience on the web. Developers can embed audio and video directly into web pages using these
                elements.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="feature2">
            <h2>Feature 2: Canvas element</h2>
            <p>The &lt;canvas&gt; element in HTML5 provides a drawing surface for creating graphics, animations, and
                interactive content. It allows developers to use JavaScript to draw shapes, images, and text
                dynamically. This feature is essential for creating web-based games, data visualizations, and
                interactive applications.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="feature3">
            <h2>Feature 3: Local Storage</h2>
            <p>HTML5 introduced the <strong>local Storage</strong> API, which allows for the storage of data on the
                user's device, improving
                the performance and reducing the need for round-trip to the server.</p>
